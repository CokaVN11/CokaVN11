# Software Engineer Intern - Zalopay

During my time on the Merchant Platform team, I contributed modest but useful pieces to merchant-facing features—mainly React/TypeScript on the frontend and Golang microservices with PostgreSQL on the backend. Working in two-week sprints alongside PMs, designers, QA, and DevOps, I focused on reliable integrations, clear APIs, and maintainable code for onboarding and store setup. I learned a great deal about payments, system design, testing, and monitoring, and I’m grateful for the mentorship and the chance to support tools that help businesses adopt digital payments.
