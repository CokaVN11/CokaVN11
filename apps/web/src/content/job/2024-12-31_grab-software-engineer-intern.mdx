# Software Engineer Intern - Grab

## Company Overview

**Grab** is Southeast Asia's leading superapp, offering ride-hailing, food delivery, digital payments, and financial services to millions of users across the region. Working at Grab's Ho Chi Minh City office, I was part of the internal tools team that builds enterprise-scale platforms to support Grab's massive operational infrastructure.

## üè¢ Role & Responsibilities

As a Software Engineer Intern on the **Internal Automation Platform** team, I worked in a distributed Agile environment with colleagues across Vietnam, Singapore, and other Southeast Asian offices. My role spanned the full development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to deployment and monitoring.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Frontend module development using Vue.js 3 with TypeScript
- Backend microservice contributions using NestJS framework
- API design and implementation for platform features
- Code review participation and quality assurance
- Cross-timezone collaboration with international team members

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture with Vue.js

I developed several key frontend modules for the low-code automation platform using modern Vue.js patterns:

```typescript
// Component architecture with Composition API
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue';
import { useRouter } from 'vue-router';

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'WorkflowBuilder',
  setup() {
    const workflowState = ref<WorkflowState>({
      nodes: [],
      connections: [],
      isRunning: false,
    });

    // Reactive state management for complex workflows
    const availableActions = computed(() =>
      filterActionsByPermission(workflowState.value.currentRole)
    );

    return { workflowState, availableActions };
  },
});
```

**Technical Challenges Solved:**

- Implemented reactive state management for complex workflow visualizations
- Created reusable component library for consistent UI patterns
- Optimized rendering performance for large-scale workflow diagrams
- Integrated real-time validation and error handling

### Backend Microservices with NestJS

Contributed to several NestJS microservices that power the automation platform:

```typescript
// NestJS service with dependency injection
@Injectable()
export class WorkflowExecutionService {
  constructor(
    private readonly workflowRepository: WorkflowRepository,
    private readonly notificationService: NotificationService,
    private readonly auditLogger: AuditLogger
  ) {}

  @Cron('*/5 * * * *') // Every 5 minutes
  async processScheduledWorkflows() {
    const pendingWorkflows = await this.workflowRepository.findByStatus(WorkflowStatus.SCHEDULED);

    await Promise.allSettled(pendingWorkflows.map((workflow) => this.executeWorkflow(workflow)));
  }
}
```

**Microservice Contributions:**

- Workflow execution engine with task scheduling
- Real-time notification system for workflow status updates
- Audit logging service for compliance and monitoring
- API gateway integration for service communication

## üé® Low-Code Platform Development

**Platform Features Developed:**

1. **Visual Workflow Builder**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for creating automation workflows
   - Real-time collaboration and conflict resolution
   - Template library for common operational processes

2. **Business Logic Engine**
   - Rule-based decision making system
   - Conditional branching and loop constructs
   - Integration with Grab's internal service ecosystem

3. **Operational Dashboard**
   - Real-time monitoring of workflow execution
   - Performance analytics and bottleneck identification
   - Error tracking and debugging tools
