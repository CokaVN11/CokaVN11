# Software Engineer Intern - Grab

During my internship on Grab’s Internal Automation Platform team in HCMC, I contributed small but meaningful pieces across the stack—building Vue 3/TypeScript modules and supporting NestJS microservices for workflow execution, notifications, and audit logging. Collaborating across time zones, I learned a great deal from code reviews and Agile routines, focusing on clear APIs, dependable deployments, and maintainable code. The experience strengthened my fundamentals in system design, testing, CI/CD, and observability, while improving cross-cultural communication and documentation. I’m grateful for the mentorship and the chance to help a low-code platform that streamlines internal operations.
