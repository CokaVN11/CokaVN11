# Freelance Full-Stack Engineer

As a remote full-stack engineer, I supported blockchain campaigns and game features across React/Vue frontends and Node/Solidity backends, focusing on clear code, reliable integrations, and thoughtful testing. Working with teams in Japan and Vietnam, I learned a lot about event-driven state management, performance tuning, and CI/CD while improving documentation and async collaboration. I’m grateful for clients’ guidance and the chance to help make apps smoother, more maintainable, and easier to scale.
